React -> divided into Components
eg:- reuse of cards, same type of blocks.
structure same ho and we can create and use them again, we call them class components.
//Interview questions - What are components ? Types of components ?

diff btwn framework and library ? eg of framework- Bootstrap[css], React[js] and library - Java ka scanner[modules][we really need to import, without importing we cant do anything..]
boostrap is not a feature of css.
Scanner is a feature of JAVA. Provides functionality..
//Check whether react is framework or library...[Correct]

React Dom is used to render website..
Container - a component containing more than one component
props isliye paas krte haii so that we dont need to create that component again with some other value..
